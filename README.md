# automation-of-the-free-lenceer-website


In this repositry I had written a code in the **main.py** file which can be use to place automatic bids on the free lencing website freeleencer (https://www.freelancer.com/). 
After placing the bids it will store all the bids in a csv file which contains the id of the bids plalced, amount and url of the projects.
